# Onboarding Document

## Introduction

This is a tutorial to help first-time contributors to contribute to our Bullet Journal Application, Flamingo Journal.

This overview will help you get comfortable making a contribution to this project.

Assuming you have [cloned](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) the [repository](https://github.com/cse110-sp21-group18/Bullet-Journal-App) and have some basic knowledge on using [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/) (or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)), let's get on with the business of contributing to the project.

### Step 1: Make a change to the project within your local fork

-   After cloning, go ahead and make any changes you desire.
-   After making the changes, commit and push your changes to your fork.
-   Next, bring changes from the upstream repository to your local fork to stay up-to-date with the original repository.
-   After resolving any merge conflicts and synchronizing with the upstream repository, move on to step 2.

---

### Step 2: Merging with the upstream repository

-   Create a pull request with the upstream repository.
-   Make sure to read the pull request template carefully; fill out all the required information and make sure to perform the steps detailed in the checklist.
-   Ensure all GitHub Actions tests pass. If not, make the necessary changes to fix any failed tests.
    -   Refer to [our guide](../onboarding/ESLint-Prettier-Local-Install-Use-Guide.md) on installing `prettier` and `eslint` for automating style fixes to your files directly.
-   After all tests have passed, add a reviewer to the pull request and any necessary tags, link any related issues, and comment any other information. Move on to step 3.

### Step 3: Wait for Results

-   Processing pull requests may take time on our end. So once we reach your pull request, if we don't have any issues with your code, we will approve and merge your changes.
-   If your pull request is not approved, the reviewer will provide feedback on your PR.
-   After your PR is approved, you are done!
